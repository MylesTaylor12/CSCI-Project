			<h1>My Favorite Videogame</h1>
			<p>One of my favorite videogames that I used to play back in high school was a game called Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. 
			The game came out in 2009, but I did not end up acquiring it until 2010 for the Xbox 360. The videogame featured many different game modes,
			including Special Ops, Multiplayer mode, and Campaign mode.
			</p>
			<p>Special Ops mode had different missions you had to complete with another player, and each mission had a specific task that you had to complete
			as you moved throughout whatever level you were playing. This game mode was very similar to Campaign mode; however, campaign mode had key differences.
			In campaign mode, each mission connected to the last, and all of the missions formed a storyline as a whole. Also, you were only allowed to play in single 
			player mode in campaign mode. In Special Ops, you could play with two people using two different controllers.
			</p>
			<p>Multiplayer mode allowed you to play with people globally using a broadband internet connection. My friends and I would play Multiplayer mode the most,
			forming our own teams and facing off against other people around the world. Great memories were formed. 
			</p>
